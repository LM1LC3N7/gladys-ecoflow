# EcoFlow

Monitor and control your EcoFlow River 2 (and the wider River 2 family: River
2 Max, River 2 Pro) directly in Gladys, through EcoFlow's cloud — the same
one the EcoFlow app itself uses.

**Important: EcoFlow devices have no LAN-only control path.** Even a device
that only ever sits on your own WiFi is controlled through EcoFlow's cloud,
both by the official app and by this integration — confirmed against
EcoFlow's own support stance (local control without internet is not
currently supported for this product line; the one exception in EcoFlow's
whole catalog is the unrelated EZ1 sprinkler-timer-sized unit). Your device
does need internet access on your network for this integration to work.

**Requires Gladys Assistant 5.1 or later** (dashboard widget and scene cards).

## Two ways to connect

- **Method 1 — Official Open Platform (recommended)**: a free developer
  account and an Access Key/Secret Key pair. Documented, and every device on
  the account is discovered automatically. The only downside is EcoFlow's
  own approval, which can take about a week.
- **Method 2 — Simple login (unofficial, optional)**: the same email and
  password you use to sign in to the EcoFlow app — no developer account, no
  waiting. This uses EcoFlow's internal app endpoints rather than the
  documented API, so it can change or break without notice, and there is no
  device auto-discovery: you type in each device's serial number by hand.

Both can be configured at once — a device is looked up through whichever
method its serial number is entered under (Method 2's field), or through
Method 1's account otherwise.

## What you get

One Gladys device is created per EcoFlow device, however it was found.
Every device exposes:

- **Battery level** (%)
- **AC charging power** (W) — power coming in through the AC input
- **Total output power** (W) — power leaving the unit across every output combined
- **AC output power** (W)
- **Solar input power** (W) — from a connected solar panel, if any
- **Discharge remaining time** (minutes) — while running on battery
- **Charging** (yes/no) — derived from the power balance (inputs above
  outputs, battery not full)
- **AC output** (on/off)
- **X-Boost** (on/off) — lets the AC output power higher-draw appliances at
  the cost of a less clean sine wave
- **DC (car) output** (on/off)
- **Backup reserve** (on/off)

A switch you flip in Gladys shows its new position at once, then the unit is
re-read a few seconds later to confirm it.

> Updating from 0.2.x: the two new sensors (remaining time, charging) make
> Gladys show an **Update** button on your device in the **Discovery** tab —
> click it to add them. Existing features and their history are kept.

## Dashboard widget

Add the **EcoFlow power station** widget to a dashboard (widget picker →
EcoFlow section) and pick a station in its settings. It shows:

- what the station is doing: "On battery · 3 h 10 left", "Charging · 300 W
  in", "Offline — not answering"…;
- live tiles: battery gauge, AC input, solar input, total output;
- the settings that are not switches: AC/DC outputs, X-Boost, backup reserve
  and its level, charge and discharge limits, connection method;
- buttons to turn the AC and DC outputs on/off — or a **Retry** button while
  the station does not answer.

## Scenes

**Triggers** (scene editor → "When…"), each with an optional station filter
(empty = any station) and the variables _battery level_ and _total output
power_:

| Trigger                   | When it fires                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wall power lost           | the AC input goes dead — e.g. a power cut on a unit used as a UPS                                                                                             |
| Wall power restored       | the AC input comes back                                                                                                                                       |
| Station stopped answering | offline in the EcoFlow cloud, or 3 failed refreshes in a row                                                                                                  |
| Station answering again   | back from the state above                                                                                                                                     |
| Charge limit reached      | the battery reaches its charge limit (100 % by default)                                                                                                       |
| Battery low               | the battery falls to 50, 30, 20, 10 or 5 % — pick the level in the _Level reached_ filter (empty = any); extra variables _level reached_ and _remaining time_ |

Each fires once per change, never at every refresh. "Battery low" fires again
only after the battery climbed 5 points back above that level. For any other
threshold ("battery below 25 %", "remaining time below 30 min"), use Gladys'
standard trigger: _A device state changes_ → the station's _Battery level_
(or _Discharge remaining time_) feature → `<` and your value, with the option
to trigger only when the threshold is crossed.

**Actions** (scene editor → "Then…"):

| Action                  | Fields                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set the charge limit    | station, max charge level (50–100 %)                                                                              |
| Set the discharge limit | station, min discharge level (0–30 %)                                                                             |
| Set the backup reserve  | station, enabled, level (5–100 %, empty keeps the current one)                                                    |
| Set AC charging         | station, AC charging power (100–1200 W), pause AC charging                                                        |
| Read the station now    | station — outputs _battery level_, _remaining time_, _input power_, _output power_, _charging_ for the next steps |

Example: "every weekday at 22:00 (off-peak), set AC charging to 600 W, not
paused; at 06:00, pause it", or "when wall power is lost, send me a message
with the battery level".

## Connection status

- The **Configuration** tab reports each method separately, after actually
  trying it — e.g. "Official API: 2 devices · Simple login failed: incorrect
  password". A serial number that does not look like one is pointed out too.
- Each device card shows a **cloud** badge, with an orange dot when the last
  refresh failed, and **unreachable** when EcoFlow reports the unit offline
  or after 3 failed refreshes in a row.

## Configuration

**Method 1 (recommended):**

1. Create a free developer account and an Access Key/Secret Key pair at the
   [EcoFlow Open Platform](https://developer-eu.ecoflow.com/) (Europe) or
   [developer.ecoflow.com](https://developer.ecoflow.com/) (global) —
   approval can take about a week.
2. Open the **Configuration** tab of the integration and enter your Access
   Key and Secret Key, and pick the matching region.
3. Save: every device on your EcoFlow account appears in the **Discovery**
   tab.

**Method 2 (simple, unofficial):**

1. Open the **Configuration** tab and enter your EcoFlow account email and
   password (the same ones the app uses).
2. Enter each device's serial number (comma-separated if more than one) —
   find it in the EcoFlow app under Settings > Device Info, or printed on
   the unit itself.
3. Save: the device(s) appear in the **Discovery** tab.

## Actions

- **Test connection** — re-polls a specific device right now and reports its
  battery level and AC output power, or the exact API error if it fails.
- **Diagnostics** — lists every telemetry key the device reports (serial
  number, Wi-Fi and network values redacted); the full list is written to the
  integration logs. Paste it into an issue when a value looks wrong, or to
  help support another model.

## Possible follow-ups

- **Real-time MQTT push** instead of polling, for Method 1 — the message
  shape of the Open Platform push topic needs confirming against a real
  account before it can complement the poll loop.
- **Other EcoFlow models** (Delta, River 3…) — per-model feature tables, fed
  by Diagnostics reports.
- **Energy categories** — Gladys 4.86 files a plug-in battery's AC input
  under the "grid" category; moving the existing _AC charging power_ feature
  there would change how Gladys counts energy, so it is left as is for now.

## Tested and confirmed

Honest status, so it's clear what "it works" actually rests on:

- **Method 2 (simple login) was tested by the maintainer on a real River 2
  Pro.** No real-account test of Method 1 is recorded here yet.
- The REST API (device list, quota snapshot, set command) and its HMAC-SHA256
  request signing (Method 1) are hand-written and cross-confirmed against two
  independent, live-used implementations read directly: the Home Assistant
  community integration
  [`tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud`](https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud)'s
  own `api/public_api.py`, and [`rustyy/ecoflow-api`](https://github.com/rustyy/ecoflow-api)'s
  `SignatureBuilder`/`RestClient` source.
- The simple login + MQTT path (Method 2) is likewise cross-confirmed against
  `tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud`'s `api/private_api.py` and
  `devices/__init__.py`.
- Every command shape (`acOutCfg`, `mpptCar`, `upsConfig`, `dsgCfg`,
  `watthConfig`, `acChgCfg`) is validated at runtime against
  [`@ecoflow-api/schemas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ecoflow-api/schemas)'
  own zod schemas.
- Safety: a command that must echo other current settings (AC output and
  X-Boost travel with the output voltage/frequency, the backup reserve with
  its level) re-reads the unit first, and is **not sent** if the unit has not
  reported those values — never a made-up default.
- **Not confirmed on a real unit yet**: the scene actions (charge/discharge
  limits, backup reserve, AC charging), the wall-power detection from
  `inv.acInVol` (when absent, the AC input power is used, confirmed on two
  refreshes in a row), and the remaining-time field. Run Diagnostics and open
  an issue if something behaves unexpectedly.

## Troubleshooting

Check the integration logs from the Gladys UI (or `docker logs` on the host)
with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for the full detail of every request made to EcoFlow,
through either method.
